         few minutes of the Astor’s new picture, “Elephant\n              Walk.” The two are casually getting acquainted in\n              an elegant mansion on a tea plantation in Ceylon.\n              Miss Taylor is the new, young wife of the plantation\n              owner and she is just out from England; Mr.\n              Andrews is the plantation boss.”Don’t mention\n              those terrible monsters!” says Mr. Andrews—or\n              words to that effect. His disregard for the creatures\n              is pungent and unreserved. The elephants roam\n              all over the plantation, trampling down the plants.\n              And they’d knock down the house, too, if a strong\n              guard of natives was not maintained. It seems that\n              the present owner’s father—”Old Master,” or “the\n              Guvnor,” as he is known—deliberately built his\n              mansion right where the elephants liked to walk.\n              Being elephants, they haven’t forgotten. That’s just\n              one of the trials Miss Taylor must endure. But\n              more disturbing to her peace and enjoyment of the\n              lthan roll his eyes. The elephants have had their\n              way, and the ghost of “old master” has been Vipbed\n              out. Is there anything more you’d like to know?\n              ELEPHANT WALK, screen play by John Lee Mahin,\n              based on a novel by Robert Standish; directed\n              by William Dieterle; produced by Irving Asher for\n            Paramount Pictures.
